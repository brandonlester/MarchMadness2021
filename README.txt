March Madness

The wrangle.R script takes the raw data provided by Kaggle (saved into data/mens-march-mania-2022) and prepares it for modeling. The output of this step includes pred_games.rds and tn_games.rds.

The model.R script takes the output from data wrangling and performs the modeling process.
